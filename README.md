# DRG-soma-model

This model was derived to analyse the results from the patch clamp. 
It is a single compartmental model that includes the following ion channels:
Kdr,
KA,
KM,
NaTTXs,
NaTTXr,
NaTTXrp,
and HCN.
The dynamcs is modeled in room temperature and no slow gates were added to the channels. 
The model is derived from the Tigerholm et al 2012 model.
